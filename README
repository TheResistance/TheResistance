How to run: 
  We are currently in dev mode and do not have a ex JAR yet. 
  Easiest way to run is to download eclipse and import the three 
  Resistance folders as an existing project. Now run ServerMain 
  then run AgentMain and/or ClientMain a combined five times to 
  start the game 
  
Iteration 1: 
  Implemented the game engine. So much fun to play!
Iteration 2: 
  Implemented the agent API and random agent inside the game engine. 
    Still bugs to work out. Exposed by agent. 
  Outside of the game engine start to create a rule based AI.
